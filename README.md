# intro-node-project

This project is meant to be an introduction to node.js. There are branches for each step

* `step-1` - We've run `yarn init` and have a `package.json` defined with the basics. We've also created our entry `src/index.js`
  * At this point you have a very basic `package.json` and simple entry-point that prints something. You can see the output by running `node .`
